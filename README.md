 ### Responsive Testing

I used Google Chrome's Development tools to constantly test each change that I made to my website and to ensure that it appeared in the desired way on different screen sizes. 
I also tested my website on different screen sizes (mobile, tablet and desktop) to ensure it appeared in the desired way on different devices.

To test my whole website, I went through each page, feature by feature, and documented the results on a spreadsheet. 
The spreadsheet also documents any responsive features and confirms that they work and appear as intended on different screen sizes.
